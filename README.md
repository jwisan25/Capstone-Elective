# Capstone-Elective
This capstone project explores sales and profit data from the Sample Superstore dataset to find patterns and insights that can help improve business performance. Using Power BI, I cleaned and visualized the data to answer key questions about product performance, shipping methods, customer segments, regional trends, and the relationship between discounts, quantity, and profit.
